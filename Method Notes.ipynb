Because methods only exist for a particular object if they have been explicitly defined for that type of object, and Python's developers have (so far) decided that those particular methods are not needed for those particular objects.\n",

For example, my_string.upper() doesn't have any listed arguments because the only required argument is the object itself, my_string.\n",
